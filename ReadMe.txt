What does ResolveAI Do?
The purpose of this game is to train an AI and teach the user how to resolve conflicts. The AI starts off as having no concern of emotion, asking the most straightforward questions. After learning about how to solve conflicts, the user applies that information in a real scenario where the AI learns from the user, becoming more human.
The information learned from this game can be applied in real life, like how you shouldn't ask personal questions when someone is mad, or how some people can be biased.

Level 1
In this level, the user learns about the deficiencies of AI in resolving conflicts. AI typically goes for the most efficient solution, not taking into account the emotional state of others, and only asking 1 person about the situation. The user then gets placed in a scenario where they have to resolve a conflict themselves, so the AI can learn from them. 

Level 2
This level is a demonstration of the newly trained AI resolving a conflict. The AI chooses answers based on what the user chose in the previous level.
